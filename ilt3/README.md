# Interpreted Lang Test 3

This is my third attempt at an interpreted language. It's implemented in Rust.
This time, I'm going to make an IR (Intermediate Representation) and run that.
This isn't really a working language, but I hope to be able to use it in my next
iteration with ILT4, mering concepts from ILT2 and ILT3.
