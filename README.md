# Interpreted Lang Test

This is a test of an interpreted language. It has lisp-like syntax, and is
implemented in Rust.

## Usage

```bash
cargo run ./test.thing
```

## Syntax

The syntax has prefix notation. Honestly just look at [test.thing](./test.thing)
for an example. I just wanted it to be easy to implement, and postfix/prefix notation is very easy to implement.

Functions are first-class, and can be passed around as arguments.
