# Interpreted Lang Test 1

This is a test of an interpreted language. It's implemented in Rust and has a
weird mix of C-like syntax and Lisp-like syntax.

## Usage

```bash
cargo run ./test.thing
```

## Syntax

The syntax has prefix notation. Honestly just look at the example `.thing`
files. I just wanted it to be easy to implement, and postfix/prefix notation is
very easy to implement.

Functions are first-class, and can be passed around as arguments.
